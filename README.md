QTooth
======

This is a fork of BluePy by Ian Harvey (Built on top of Bluez) at version 1.3.0.
The reason for this is Quantum specific adaptations to a number of scripts.
The purpose of modification is to interject in some scripts, to collect information before it is parsed into a different format and some information gets lost.
